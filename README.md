 ## Config options
 To deploy the application the mysql database url, s3 bucket and the smtp server have to be set.
 The configuration for the play app is in /conf/application.conf
 
 The following configurations need to be adjusted:
 
 ```
 db.default{
  driver="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
  url="jdbc:mysql://<mysql_url>"
  username=<mysql_username>
  password="<mysql_password>"
  host="<hostname>"
  jndiName=DefaultDS
}
```

```
//alternative smtp server can be used, example is with google smtp with tls
play.mailer {
  debug = true
  host = "smtp.gmail.com" 
  port = 587
  ssl = false
  tls = true
  user = "<username (email)>"
  password = "<password>"
  timeout=60000
  connectiontimeout=60000
  //https://myaccount.google.com/u/3/lesssecureapps zulassen
}

```

```
aws.accessKey="<access_key>"
aws.secretKey="<secret_key>"
cheapeat.s3.bucketName="<s3_bucket_name>"
```

```
//site hostname for urls building
server.hostname = "<hostname url>"
```
  
 # Future developments
 The following futures should be developed to deploy the application is deployed in a productive environment
  - Users should be able to reset password (via forget password or password change)
  - Users should be able to update addresses
  - Users should be able to add additional addresses and add different addresses to offers
  - Images should be saved as thumnails, be shown full size when clicked on thumbnail
  - Users should be able to edit and delete created offers
